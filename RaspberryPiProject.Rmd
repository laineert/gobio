#Creating A Raspberry Pi Supercomputer 
This document will show the steps that were taken to successfully create a raspberry pi supercomputer.
>A raspbery pi is a small computer that is affordable! Raspberry pi's use a programming language called python. These mini computers can be used for things such as home security systems, robots, and web servers. 
-There are several components that make up a raspberry pi such as:
-CPU
-RAM
-general purpose input and output connector
-ethernet connectors
-USB ports
-audio jacks and many more 

##methods 
1. Do the research 
2. Order the supplies needed
3. Assemble each raspberry pi into its casing
4. Attach the raspberry pi's to make a cluster 
5. Sync the cluster together using a monitor

###research 
Each member of the group did their own research as to how to assemble a raspberry pi, what its function is, and how it works. 

###Supplies 
To create a raspberry pi supercomputer with 4 nodes we used: 
-4 raspberry pi 
-4 ethernet cables 
-1 ethernet hub 
-4 micro SD cards 
-4 power cords
-1 power strip
-1 cluster case 
-1 desktop monitor 
-4 HDMI cords 

###Assembly 
To assemble the raspberry pi's into a cluster we had to screw each fan into the casing for the pi's. We then were able to screw each pi on top of each other like a stack of pancakes. 
>Each pi was connected to its own power source. Next, ethernet cables were connected to each pi, and then to the central ethernet hub. 
> After this, each micro SD card had to be synced together so that they would function as one unit.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
