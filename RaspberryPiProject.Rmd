#Creating A Raspberry Pi Supercomputer 
This document will show the steps that were taken to successfully create a raspberry pi supercomputer.
>A raspbery pi is a small computer that is affordable! Raspberry pi's use a programming language called python. These mini computers can be used for things such as home security systems, robots, and web servers. 
-There are several components that make up a raspberry pi such as:
-CPU
-RAM
-general purpose input and output connector
-ethernet connectors
-USB ports
-audio jacks and many more 

##methods 
1. Do the research 
2. Figure out where to obtain the supplies
3. Order the supplies needed
4. Assemble each raspberry pi into the casing along with the fans
5. Attach the raspberry pi's to make a cluster 
6. Sync the cluster together using a monitor

###research 
Each member of the group did their own research as to how to assemble a raspberry pi, what its function is, and how it works. 

###Supplies 
To create a raspberry pi supercomputer with 4 nodes we used: 
-4 raspberry pi 
-4 ethernet cables 
-1 ethernet hub 
-4 micro SD cards 
-4 power cords
-1 power strip
-1 cluster case 
-1 desktop monitor 
-4 HDMI cords 

###Assembly 
To assemble the raspberry pi's into a cluster we had to screw each fan into the casing for the pi's. We then were able to screw each pi on top of each other like a stack of pancakes. 
>Each pi was connected to its own power source. Next, ethernet cables were connected to each pi, and then to the central ethernet hub. 
> After this, each micro SD card had to be synced together so that they would function as one unit.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
