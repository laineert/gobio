First, raspberry pi immager was downloaded onto the PC
Rasbparian lite 64 bit was installed on every microSD card and then installed into the pis
once in, the following command was executed on each pi to get its IP: "Sudo ip a"
the ssh was installed and updated with the following commands: "sudo apt install ssh" and "sudo apt uprade -y"
the system was allowed to update and then the following command was given to ensure the SSH was working: "sudo systemclt status ssh" 
after this the pi was access through ssh through a desktop PC
the following command was executed to open/edit a file: "sudo cat /boot/cmdline.txt
      after the "rootwait" the following was inputed: "cgroup_memory=1 cgroup_enable=memory"
the pi was allowed to restart

from here, the following command was exectured to instal the correct software and start the master node: "curl -sfl https://get.k3s.io | sh -"
it was allowed to install, and the following command was executed to check the success: "sudo Kubectl get nodes"
after this the following comman was exectued on the master node to get the token: "sudo cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token"
this token was placed into the following command and was executed on the three other nodes: "curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://8.40.198.78:6443 K3S_TOKEN=K1061db9444c18d991327a05d088ed202bff08de8fbca0f40353c3018c69e115afb::server:0f3d371d5a525eac57791d32dcc6d3d5 sh -?
this was done to all three nodes
